First, you need to have some libraries installed to compile: glfw GLEW SOIL freetype ftgl vorbisfile alure openal enet eigen
On Debian based systems, search for the -dev packages and install them all.

You also need CMake 2.8 or greater installed.

<b>C++</b>
Make your game in game/game.cpp

Then, from inside the cmake/ folder, do:
<span class="command">cmake .. && make</span>

This makes your game, too, which is placed at bin/game.

<b>Python</b>
You need SWIG 2.0.3 or later, or you can uncomment line 7 in python_engine/compile.
Run <span class="command">python_engine/compile</span> to genereate the Python bindings.

Make your game anywhere and be happy about not having to recompile.
