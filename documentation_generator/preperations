To compile, you first need to have some libraries installed:

<a href="http://glfw.org">OpenGL Framework</a> (glfw)
<a href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/">OpenGL Extention Wrangler</a> (GLEW)
<a href="http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html">Simple OpenGL Image Library</a> (SOIL)
<a href="http://www.freetype.org/">FreeType</a> (freetype)
<a href="http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/henryj/code/#FTGL">FTGL</a> (ftgl)
<a href="http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/doc/vorbisfile/">Vorbisfile</a> (vorbisfile)
<a href="http://kcat.strangesoft.net/alure.html">AL Utilities REtooled</a> (alure)
<a href="http://openal.org">OpenAL</a> (openal)
<a href="http://enet.bespin.org/">ENet</a> (enet)
<a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org">Eigen</a> (eigen)

On <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a>-based systems this can be done with a single command:

<span class="command">sudo apt-get install libglfw-dev libglew1.5-dev libsoil-dev libfreetype6-dev libftgl-dev libvorbisfile3 libalure-dev libopenal-dev libenet-dev libeigen3-dev</span>
[notice]Eigen needs to be version 3.  You will probably have to install the dev package manually.
[notice]alure needs to be version >= 1.1.  Currently you may have to build it from source if it's not in the repository.
[notice]enet needs to be version >= 1.3.1.  Currently you may have to build it from source if it's not in the repository.

You also need <a href="http://cmake.org">CMake</a> 2.8 or greater installed.

Now run:
<span class="command">./compile</span>

For Python support, you need Python version 3.1 and <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a> 2.0.3 or later.  Go into <span class="command">python_engine</span> and run:
<span class="command">./compile</span>
[notice]SWIG 2.0.3 may not be released yet, so you'll have to build and install it from source if it isn't.
