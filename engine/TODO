MAIN
	Make mouse_position return a tuple in python
	window close callback ... need to save canvas before destroyed
	glfwSetWindowCloseCallback ;;;; report if user wants to close window
	glfwEnable( GLFW_KEY_REPEAT );
	background_image rotation


DISPLAY
	glMultiTexCoord2fARB coords...glTexCoordPointer (maybe pass a rect in)
	fix mquad() to not map to screen with, but image....................[really?]
	Enhance the write function to incorperate all capabilities of the draw function
	pixel() needs to be able to get from the front or back buffer
	Enable fullscreen switching | fullscreen(true);
	mouse pos and button callbacks
	joystick support

NETWORK
	host.disconnect() disconencts from all connected peers, (otherhost) still does from one

FBO
	Not just high quality or not
	need to be able to chage the viewport...

FONT
	...

PIXELCACHE
	Internal type, rgb(a)

IMAGE
	Color -> transparent
	Easy way to edit a texture? Reload?
	Refresh part of pixel cache

SOUND
	Make functions to read and write to the buffer
	MIDI support...
	seek streams

OTHER
	Implement box2d / Bullet Physics
	
	Make an example extention (like loading .blends, or bezier support)
	
	MOVIE support
	
	RESOURCE
		A filebuffer
		A new type that can be passed to anything
		Can be loaded from anywhere
		Using PhysFX?
	
	Images, FBOs, will eventually need support for depth and stencil buffers....and changing type RGB, RGBA, UNSIGNED_BYTE
	open window with depth buffer support
	
	Go to webpage / open file in it's own editor?
