MAIN
	Make mouse_position return a tuple in python
	window resize...callback....
	window close callback ... need to save canvas before destroyed
	glfwEnable( GLFW_KEY_REPEAT );


DISPLAY
	glMultiTexCoord2fARB coords...glTexCoordPointer (maybe pass a rect in)
	fix mquad() to not map to screen with, but image....................[really?]
+	'shift' = 'left/right shift'
	Enhance the write function to incorperate all capabilities of the draw function
	pixel() needs to be able to get from the front or back buffer
	Enable fullscreen switching | fullscreen(true);
	glfwSetWindowCloseCallback ;;;; report if user wants to close window
	mouse pos and button callbacks
	joystick support

FBO
	Not just high quality or not
	Rename buffer_image to buffer
	need to be able to chage the viewport...

FONT
	...

PIXELCACHE
	Internal type, rgb(a)

IMAGE
	Color -> transparent
	Easy way to edit a texture? Reload?
	Refresh part of pixel cache

SOUND
	Make functions to read and write to the buffer
	MIDI support...
	Use allure "Automatic Playback" functions to update streams and such

SPEAKER
	Play multiple sources of the same buffer (sounds may not need their own source)

OTHER
	Implement box2d / Bullet Physics
	
	CONTEXT
		Make a context class that holds the current speaker, display, ...
	
	Make an example extention (like loading .blends, or bezier support)
	
	MOVIE support
	
	RESOURCE
		A filebuffer
		A new type that can be passed to anything
		Can be loaded from anywhere
		Using PhysFX?
	
	Images, FBOs, will eventually need support for depth and stencil buffers....and changing type RGB, RGBA, UNSIGNED_BYTE
	open window with depth buffer support
	
	Document
	
	Go to webpage / open file in it's own editor?
